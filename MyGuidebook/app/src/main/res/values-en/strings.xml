    <string name="textOne">Machu Picchu (Quechua - Old Peak) is a pre-Columbian Inca city located in the Andes at an altitude of 2400 m at the top of a mountain ridge above the Urubambi River valley in Peru, 80 km from the modern city of Cuzco. It is believed that the city was built as a sacred mountain shelter by the great Inca ruler Pachakutek a century before the fall of his empire, that is, around 1440.
The inhabitants left Machu Picchu in 1532, shortly after the invasion of their conquerors by the Spanish conquerors. Although the conquistadors never reached Machu Picchu.</string>
